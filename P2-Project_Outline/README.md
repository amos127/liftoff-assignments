## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This app will help folks see patterns between their behavior and how they feel.
It will combine habit tracking and food tracking with users adding physical and mental health symptoms they may feel.
Storing this in one place will help people see potential associations with how they eat or what behaviors or events could trigger negative or positive physical and mental health symptoms, such as anxiety or feeling tired.
My inspiration for this app has been my own trial and error with trying to improve my well-being and better manage health conditions.

1. User Login: Users will be able to create a login and basic profile.
2. Add and remove habits and other data that will be stored in a mySQL database.
3. Photos: Users can upload photos and view in a gallery sorted by date.

### Technologies
Java
Spring Boot
MySQL
Hibernate

### What I'll Have to Learn
1. How to allow users to add and store photos.
2. How to create and display visualizations of a user's data.
3. I'll need to really improve my Angular and HTML/CSS skills to create a better front end.
